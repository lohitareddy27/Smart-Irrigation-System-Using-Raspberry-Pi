# Smart-Irrigation-System-Using-Raspberry-Pi
This project implements a Smart Irrigation System using a Raspberry Pi, temperature sensor, moisture sensor, and rain sensor. The system automates the irrigation process based on real-time environmental conditions and ensures efficient water usage.
How It Works
Sensors Read Data:

Temperature Sensor (TMP36): Measures ambient temperature.
Moisture Sensor (MCP3008): Detects soil moisture level.
Rain Sensor: Detects rainfall presence.
Data Processing:

The Raspberry Pi reads the sensor values using the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus.
It converts the analog data from sensors into digital form for further processing.
Decision Making:

If temperature > 25Â°C, moisture level < 100, and no rain detected, the motor starts.
Otherwise, the motor remains off.
Motor Control:

The motor (connected via a relay) is turned ON or OFF based on the sensor readings.
LCD Display:

Displays real-time temperature, moisture levels, and motor status.
SMS Notification:

Sends an SMS alert to the registered user via UART communication whenever the motor starts or stops.
